# Lcloud - Local analogue of icloud
## about the project

My task was to abandon the icloud service (now I'm on android) because it had its limitations. I wanted to freely transfer photos and videos to my computer without quality loss.

project site https://yarchefis.ru/lcloud
## supported OS

By default the server runs on windows but you can get the site files from www and run them on your operating system.



## Installation and Configuration
Okay let's start. 

-download the zip archive and extract it to a convenient location. 

-Press ```WIN+R``` and type ```shell:startup``` 

-in the Lcoud folder, find the ```start_server.bat``` file and create a shortcut in the opened ```shell:startup``` folder. 

-after starting the computer, Lcloud will start by itself, if you want to start it now, just run the shortcut. 

#### if you get errors, run the file again or run the UniController.exe utility and press the start Apache button
